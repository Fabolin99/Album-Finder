# Overview

The album finder program allows the user to find a specific album of the requested artist. This is possible thanks to 
the API that Spotify provides to all developers. Not to mention that the program displays a user-friendly search bar
that prompts the user for an artist. 

Thanks to all the token, url, and documentation provided by the API, the program is straightforward and easy to
understand. I followed all the documentation that requests and retrieves all the information about the artist by 
looking for the artist ID number. 

This program allows to all music lovers the possibility to search the albums of the artists that they love. 
Provides an easy and straightforward way to find albums among thousands of artist around the world.

# Web Pages

Because React is implemented in this project, I only use one JavaScript file that fulfills all the functions of
the program. It allows to search, request and display the artist ID in the same file. Consequently, it displays 
the album. Everything in the same JavaScript file.
